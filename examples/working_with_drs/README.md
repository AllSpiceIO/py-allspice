# Example: Working with DRs

This example shows how to work with design reviews, including such things as adding
a comment and an attachment. [The Jupyter notebook](./working_with_drs.ipynb) is a tour
of DR functionality and shows how to use the API. [The script](./add_bom_to_dr.py) is an
example script that generates a BOM on a DR and adds it as a comment, showcasing one of
the ways in which you can use py-allspice in your CI pipeline.
