# py-allspice Usage Examples

This directory contains examples which show how to use py-allspice. The examples may be
presented as Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, or both. The Jupyter notebooks are
intended to be "guided tours" through common functionality, while the Python scripts
are intended to be more "plug and play" examples that you can use as a reference or even
directly in your projects.

In either case, you should always be careful about running code that you don't understand
on any repository that you care about. Make sure you fully understand what the code is
doing, and make any changes to suit your circumstances or use case before running them.
